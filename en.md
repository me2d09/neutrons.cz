## About Czech Neutron Association

The Czech Neutron Association is a professional society bringing together scientists, students, and other specialists who make use of neutron radiation in their work. The mission of the association is to support the development of research in this field at both the national and international level, to connect the expert community, and to actively advocate for its interests.

The association strives to strengthen the position of neutron research in the Czech Republic not only by supporting scientific collaboration, but also by engaging with European and global infrastructures. It serves as an open platform for sharing information, coordinating activities, and fostering strategic dialogue among research institutions, public authorities, and the wider public.

### Our goals are to:

- connect the community of Czech neutron users across disciplines and institutions
- promote research using neutron radiation across the full spectrum of scientific fields
- facilitate communication between the expert community, academic institutions, public authorities, and the general public
- represent the Czech Republic in international neutron structures, institutions, and thematic networks
